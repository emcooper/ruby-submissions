### Project Template

Note: I am pivoting from my initial idea because I just remembered about this idea that I had had a while ago. Due a lot of other obligations going on this weekend and over the next couple days, I haven't had much time to think about the technlogies or the specifics of the app. I think one of the challenges will be getting the data, as their may not be a central place to get this data for all 50 states, it may vary by state. If their ends up not being a way to do this I may switch back to my Not Here to Make Friends react native app idea. 

### School Funding Map and Analysis (will come up with a real name)

### Pitch

1 sentence that explains the value proposition of the application. How would you explain it to a potential business partner, team member, or investor?

This app would map and analyze school district financial and performance data (possibly including: dollars spend per pupil,  liquidity rate, tax rate, bond rating, bond interest rate, graduation rate, college attendance rate) in order to allow the user to make connections about the inequalities in school funding.

### Problem

1-3 sentences describing the problem that you are trying to solve.

Most people are generally aware that school funding is unequal but I think it takes numbers and data to make them see how cyclical the problem is. 

### Solution

1-3 sentences describing how your application will solve that problem.

The application will show how schools in poor communities have less money, are taxing their communities more, and due to this have lower bond ratings which makes getting more money more expensive (or in some cases impossible), than in richer communities. This all obviusly leads to lower performance. 

### Target Audience

1-3 sentences describing what type of user your app would be applicable to.

Anyone, particularly people interested in economic inequality.

### New Techniques

I'll have to do more research but possibly go, or Node. I am open to suggestions. 

### Workflow
